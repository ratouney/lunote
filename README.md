# Lunote - A world of Javascript

The point of this project is to setup all parts of a WebApp in Javascript. The app will be a simple timetracker which will be synchronized across all devices.

## I - API Backend

For this part, we'll be using `express` as a base and link it with the Google Firebase because SQL is for people living in the past. We'll be using Swagger to create a documentation and probably try to add Babel because ES6 is looks better.
